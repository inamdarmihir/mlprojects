## Project 1: Project Title

### Overview

Provide a brief overview of the project, including the problem domain, project origin, and related datasets or input data.

### Problem Statement

Clearly define the problem that needs to be solved and the strategy for solving the problem, including a discussion of the expected solution.

### Metrics

Define the metrics used to measure the performance of the model or result, and justify them based on the characteristics of the problem.

### Data Exploration

Discuss the features and calculated statistics relevant to the problem, and provide a thorough description of the input data. Identify any abnormalities or characteristics about the data that need to be addressed.

### Data Preprocessing

Document all preprocessing steps and explain how any abnormalities or characteristics about the data have been corrected. If no data preprocessing is necessary, justify why.

### Implementation

Thoroughly document the process for implementing metrics, algorithms, and techniques with the given datasets or input data. Discuss any complications that occurred during the coding process.

### Model Evaluation and Validation

Evaluate the final model's qualities, such as parameters, and validate the robust
