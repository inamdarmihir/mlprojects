## Project 1: Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

### Overview
This project centers around the task of customer segmentation using the K-Means Clustering algorithm. The objective is to categorize customers based on their purchasing behavior and identify distinct segments for targeted marketing strategies.

### Problem Statement
The challenge is to analyze a customer dataset and group customers into clusters based on their purchasing behavior. The desired outcome is a set of customer segments that can guide personalized marketing campaigns.

### Metrics
The model's performance will be assessed using metrics such as within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) and silhouette score. These metrics aid in evaluating the clustering quality and the separation between different customer segments.

### Data Exploration
The dataset contains valuable customer information, including purchasing behavior. Data exploration will unravel feature distributions, detect outliers, and offer insights into the customer segments.

### Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps, encompassing missing value handling and feature normalization, will be executed to ensure reliable clustering results. Outliers and inconsistencies will also be addressed during this phase.

### Implementation
The K-Means Clustering algorithm will be applied to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The preprocessed data will serve as input, and the resulting clusters will be analyzed.

### Model Evaluation and Validation
The final model, encompassing the number of clusters and customer segments, will be assessed and validated. Performance metrics will gauge the clustering effectiveness and the interpretability of the generated segments.
